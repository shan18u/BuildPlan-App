#  Build_Plan_Vote

**This Mobile Application offers a comprehensive solution to source data on unoccupied lands that are currently available for sale within the region.**<br><br>

Build Plan, a new app, aims to tackle this problem by utilizing empty lands for sale and empowering local residents to make decisions on the development of these lands into affordable housing through voting rights within the app. Through Build Plan, we aim to collaboratively work with residents to reach mutually beneficial solutions, including compensation where necessary, for the development of affordable apartment complexes.

**_Below is the preview of the app:_**<br><br>
The recent change in the source website, from one image per row to multiple images per row, has caused the images to not display in the app. To resolve this issue, I plan to replace the current RecyclerView with a nested RecyclerView, effectively switching from single arrays to nested arrays. This update will enable the app to process multiple images per row. I am confident in my ability to make this change and look forward to implementing it soon.
