#  Build_Plan_Vote

**_Mobile App that scrapes gets the data of all the empty lands that are currently on sale in the San Jose Area._**<br><br>
Homelessness is a widespread and pressing issue in cities across the world. While the market for solutions to the homelessness crisis is vast, there are limited effective solutions available. Build Plan, a new app, aims to tackle this problem by utilizing empty lands for sale and empowering local residents to make decisions on the development of these lands into affordable housing through voting rights within the app. Through Build Plan, we aim to collaboratively work with residents to reach mutually beneficial solutions, including compensation where necessary, for the development of affordable apartment complexes.

**_Below is the preview of the app:_**<br><br>
The recent change in the source website, from one image per row to multiple images per row, has caused the images to not display in the app. To resolve this issue, I plan to replace the current RecyclerView with a nested RecyclerView, effectively switching from single arrays to nested arrays. This update will enable the app to process multiple images per row. I am confident in my ability to make this change and look forward to implementing it soon.
 
<br>In other words switch from arrays to nested arrays. I will fix this small change and will update the code.
